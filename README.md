# Phishing Email Detection

- This project implements a phishing email detection system using machine learning techniques. The goal is to classify emails as either "phishing" or "legitimate" based on their content.
- Phishing attacks are a significant threat in the digital world, where attackers impersonate legitimate entities to steal sensitive information. This project aims to build a model that can effectively identify phishing emails using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of sample emails labeled as either "phishing" or "legitimate." The dataset is stored in a CSV file named `emails.csv`, which includes the following columns:
- **text**: The content of the email.
- **label**: The classification of the email (either "phishing" or "legitimate").
The dataset can be expanded or modified as needed to improve model performance.

## Requirements
To run this project, you need the following Python libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- nltk
- joblib

You can install the required libraries using pip:
`pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn nltk joblib`


## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
- git clone https://github.com/yourusername/phishing-email-detection.git
- cd phishing-email-detection
2. Install the required libraries as mentioned above.

## Usage
1. Create the Dataset: Run the following script to create the `emails.csv` file:
`python create_emails_csv.py`
2. Run the Phishing Email Detection: Execute the main script to train the models and evaluate their performance
   `python phishing_email_detection.py`

3. View Results: The script will output the model evaluations, including accuracy, classification reports, confusion matrices, and cross-validation scores.
